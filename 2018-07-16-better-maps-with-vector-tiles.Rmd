### Whats a vector tile?



### Mapzen and rmapzen

This post relies on [Tarek's](https://twitter.com/tarakc02) excellent [rmapzen](https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen) package which provides an R front-end to several Mapzen APIs. From the description: 

> rmapzen is a client for any implementation of the Mapzen API. Though Mapzen itself has gone out of business, rmapzen can be set up to work with any provider who hosts Mapzenâ€™s open-source software, including geocode.earth, Nextzen, and NYC GeoSearch from NYC Planning Labs. For more information, see https://mapzen.com/documentation/. The project is available on github as well as CRAN.

[Mapzen](https://mapzen.com) was an innovative business that tried to be viable by making unreal open-source software with an emphasis on web mapping and geography products. These tools included a digital map rendering engine, search and routing services, open-source data tools for map data, terrain, and transit, gazeteers, and tile servers. This included an excellent vector tile service using OpenStreetMap data. Unfortunately Mapzen is now defunct but a number of other providers continue to host Mapzen's open-source tools. 

Thanks to an [AWS Research Award](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/research-credits/) [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org) will continue to host the vector tile service through 2018 (and hopefully longer). 

### Install and get yourself an API key

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("rmapzen")
```
Create a key at (https://developers.nextzen.org) and save it as an environment variable or as an option in your `.rprofile` for persistency across sessions, and tell `rmapzen` to use Nextzen as it's tile host. (The package author has developed interfaces to a few other hosting services since Mapzen shutdown.)
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
options(nextzen_API_key="your_key")
mz_set_tile_host_nextzen(key = nextzen_API_key)
```



### Alternative sources for vector tiles

I continue Nextzen for vector tiles and have no issues with usage through my free-level API access, but there are some alternatives out there like [Thunderforest](https://thunderforest.com) and [Mapcat](https://www.mapcat.com) that have free/hobbyist access tiers to their vector tile APIs. There is also [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.com/downloads/planet/) where you can download different types of vector tiles in bulk (note that the files are enormous in size) for free for non-commercial uses. 





## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
